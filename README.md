# vm0

**vm0** is a tiny stack-based virtual machine with big dreams. It
knows about pushing, popping, jumping, and just enough arithmetic to
get into trouble. It has no heap, no types, no objects—just a good old
stack and a Lisp-powered brain.

Think of it as a friendly CPU emulator that’s trying its best. It
comes with a minimal instruction set, macro expansion (because typing
:pick all the time is frustrating), and a DIY calling convention made
out of chewing gum and roll instructions.
